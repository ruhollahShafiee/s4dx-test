# Read Me First
The following was discovered as part of building this project:

* extract matching strings from an array regardless of the character order
* I have used multiplying prime numbers to find the target String(which we want to find). For doing this, I have mapped each character of the main array element to the primes index and I multiplied and saved them into a Map as(key, List\<String\>) in the Finder Constructor body.
  and in the find method, I just get from the map.
